              <h2>
                The Schools need is a <br />
                new age tool
              </h2>
              <p>
                Team SchoolerPro was born out of the desperation, doubt and
                anxiety that affected schools when COVID19 became a reality. But
                it is designed to outlast not only outlast the pandemic but also
                re-imagine pedagogy for the New Generation of Students. Indian
                Schools, though may face a lot of criticism for the means of
                imparting education, they still remain the powerhouse of
                educating so many students.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                At SchoolerPro, we believe that what the Schools need is a new
                age tool, that helps in managing content and making it
                seamlessly available for their students to consume. SchoolerPro
                is imagined as a platform that unites - Teacher, Students,
                Administrators, Third Party content creator with the sole aim of
                re-inventing a child’s education. All this without burning the
                pockets of parents in a pay-as-you-go model.

                <h2>Creating tomorrow’s solutions for today.</h2>
                <p>
                  At SchoolerPro, we believe in creating tomorrow’s solutions
                  for today. Education in India has always been a fast-paced
                  industry where huge numbers are pitted against each other by
                  institutions and upcoming EdTech Startups alike. We Beg to
                  Differ. We are a platform that lets every teacher enhance her
                  lesson and every student learn in a digital, real-world and
                  scaleable way. Nature has already done a great job of already
                  giving the kids a very plastic brain that just needs to be
                  guided. We just have to keep feeding those guns and kids can
                  imagine a world even better and smarter than us.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Our logo emphasises our approach - Emphasise Application. Our
                  logo is designed from a rather simple invention of a well
                  known learned man. Pythagoras is so well known in India,
                  thanks to his a^2 + b^2 = c^2 formula. In a poetically
                  infamous way, this marks the single greatest rote-learned
                  formula by many students in India. But Pythagoras is more than
                  meets the eye. He loved the application of things with as much
                  passion as he learned them. Our logo is based on a Pythagoras
                  Cup. When filled under a certain level, the glass will hold
                  its contents. Get greedy and fill more, it will empty
                  everything with a vengeance, there is nothing one can do. Now,
                  that is an application and that is why we love it - A fun,
                  scientific toy that involves simple craftsmanship and takes a
                  jab at a complex social problem of greed. That is high art.
                  Which is what we want to be in the field of education.
